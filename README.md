# House Price Prediction
House Price Prediction
It is a machine learning project where house prices in Istanbul are estimated.

I paid attention to be the same sample distribution and population distribution. First of all, the distribution of the total advertisements in Istanbul by district and house types was examined and the number of advertisements in a certain percentage was taken in the main.py file. Then, the ads were scraped in the scraping.py file according to the post numbers.The raw data set consists of approximately 35000 house advertisements.

After that, I follow the general roadmap in data analysis processes:

- We will look over the dataset and basic data cleaning process.
- We will use visualizations for the better understanding the variables.
- Then, We will look for relationship between variables via statistical calculations. We will make changes to the data if necessary.
- We will examine outliers,missing and contradictory observations and make the necessary preliminary processes before modeling.
- Finally, we will fit my model and end my project.
