# House Price Prediction
House Price Prediction
It is a machine learning project where house prices in Istanbul are estimated.

I paid attention to the same sample distribution and population distribution. First of all, the distribution of the total advertisements in Istanbul by district and house types was examined and the number of advertisements in a certain percentage was taken in the main.py file. Then, the ads were scraped in the scraping.py file according to the post numbers.The raw data set consists of approximately 35000 house advertisements.

Then, data was cleaned, visualized, pre-processed and finally model fitted.
